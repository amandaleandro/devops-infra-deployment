# Implementation Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides a step-by-step process for implementing the DevOps infrastructure using Terraform. The project automates the deployment of a WordPress application on AWS with added features like scaling, observability, and secret management.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed and configured:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure for better management and scalability:

├── terraform/
│ ├── main.tf
│ ├── variables.tf
│ ├── outputs.tf
│ ├── modules/
│ │ ├── vpc/
│ │ ├── ec2/
│ │ ├── rds/
│ │ ├── eks/
│ │ ├── secrets/
│ │ ├── auto_scaling/
│ │ └── wordpress/
└── observability/
├── function/
├── lambda_function.py
├── requirements.txt
└── init.py

bash
Copiar código

## Steps for Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/devops-infra-deployment.git
cd devops-infra-deployment/terraform
2. Initialize Terraform
Initialize the Terraform project to download provider plugins:


terraform init
3. Review and Edit Variables
Edit the variables.tf file or create a terraform.tfvars file to provide your custom values:

hcl
Copiar código
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Password for the RDS database"
  type        = string
}

variable "aws_access_key_id" {
  description = "AWS access key ID"
  type        = string
}

variable "secret_access_key" {
  description = "AWS secret access key"
  type        = string
}
4. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run the following command to deploy the infrastructure:

bash
Copiar código
terraform apply
Confirm the apply by typing "yes" when prompted.

5. Verify the Deployment
Once the Terraform deployment is complete, you can verify the resources in your AWS Management Console.

Infrastructure Components
VPC: A Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets.
EC2: Instances to host the WordPress application.
RDS: A MySQL database for WordPress.
EKS: A Kubernetes cluster for containerized workloads.
Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager for secure management of credentials.
Auto Scaling: Policies to manage scaling of resources based on demand.
Monitoring and Cleanup
The infrastructure includes CloudWatch alarms and a Lambda function that triggers automatic cleanup of resources after 20 minutes of inactivity.

Troubleshooting
Terraform Errors: Check the Terraform output for specific errors and adjust the variables as needed.
AWS Errors: Ensure your AWS credentials are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions.
